          <p> 
Sitar is a framework for modeling and parallel simulation of synchronous discrete-event systems in 
            application domains such as networks, computer architecture models, clocked digital systems, and discrete-time queueing networks.
It consists of a system description language and a lightweight simulation kernel.  
A system is described as a set of concurrent, interconnected modules 
operating on a global clock.  The language supports hierarchical
descriptions: modules can contain instances of other modules.
The behavior of each module can be described in an imperative manner as a
sequence of statements.  The language supports constructs such as :
</p>

<ul>
<li>Time delays</li>
<li>Fork-join Parallel blocks</li>
<li>Branch/loop constructs</li>
<li>Procedures and</li>
<li>Code blocks (instantaneous)</li>
</ul>

<p> 
In addition, C++ code can be embedded into a module description 
in a straightforward and well-defined manner.
Each module description gets translated to a C++ class. The generated code can
be compiled and linked together with the simulation kernel to get a single
simulation executable. The simulation kernel consists of a
small set of C++ classes, and supports parallel execution using OpenMP. 
The simulation uses a two-phase algorithm for deterministic execution : each clock cycle
is divided into two phases, and input/output events are restricted to separate phases.
 </p>

<p>Sitar can be used for modeling discrete-event systems such as 
computer-architectural models, communication 
networks and discrete-time queues. It is written for Linux.</p>
