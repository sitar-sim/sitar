# Sitar V2.0


Sitar is a framework for modeling and parallel simulation of synchronous discrete-event systems.
It consists of a system description language and a lightweight, C++-based simulation kernel.  


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
	* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18/20/22)
	* Python3
	* SCons
	* gcc (version >=4.5)
	* OpenMP 

### Installation
	1. Run the install script in the terminal `./install.py`
	This should generate an executable "sitar_translator" inside ./translator/parser folder

	2. Add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file to use the sitar translator and compiler executables outside the installation folder. Replace *<path>*  
	   with absolute path of this folder

	> #-------------------------
	> #sitar paths:
	> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-sitar>/translator/antlr3Cruntime/build/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
	> export PATH=<path-to-sitar>/scripts:${PATH}
	> #-------------------------

	3. Refer to /examples/README for running examples.

	4. Type "sitar -h" at the terminal for command options.

	5. (Optional) for enabling syntax highlighting inside Vim editor 
	for sitar language, refer to vim/README
