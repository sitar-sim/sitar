# Sitar V2.0


Sitar is a framework for modeling and parallel simulation of synchronous discrete-event systems.\
It consists of a custom modeling language and a lightweight, C++ based simulation kernel.
#

Here's an example of a behavioral description in Sitar, the corresponding control flow and the simulation output:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18/20/22)
* Python3
* SCons
* gcc (version >=4.5)
* OpenMP 

### Installation
1. Download or clone this repository, enter the repository and run the installation script by typing `./install.py` in your terminal. This should generate an executable called `sitar_translator` inside the `translator/parser` folder.
   
3. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file to use the sitar commands outside the installation folder. Replace `<path>` with absolute path of the installation folder.
   ```
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-sitar>/translator/antlr3Cruntime/build/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
   export PATH=<path-to-sitar>/scripts:${PATH}
   ```
### Usage
- Refer to `/examples/README` for running examples.
- Type `sitar -h` at the terminal for command options.
- (Optional) for enabling syntax highlighting inside Vim editor for sitar language, refer to `vim/README`\

### This folder contains
